            'I think of an NFT as - it\'s as general a concept as the webpage. But it\'s a core new concept, the idea of owning something on the internet.  When it first comes out, people are like, "Oh it\'s a website" and they try to map it to the offline world.',
            '{coin} is an internet owned by users and builders orchestrated with tokens.',
            'Today the frontier is on the internet and even on the internet, the frontier is within Web3 and {coin} because it\'s sort of the least regulated the most decentralized, most permissionless, 24x7x365 markets that are self-funding hackers from all around the world.',
            'The internet is not bad for creative people. Web2 is bad for creative people.',
            'If Bitcoin can have value, if Ethereum can have value, then in theory, {coin} can have value as long as the smart contracts and the social contracts and the community enforcing it has value.',
            'A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. So in that sense, {coin} is primitive, and people are going to recombine, and assemble, and compose those primitives to create incredibly complex systems.',
            'It has to go through the same adoption curve that Web2 and Web1 did. And in theory, it could even go faster. Because tokens naturally have an incentive mechanism built-in. The token companies don\'t need to do much marketing. The marketing is done by the users.',
            'So there\'s just this huge opportunity now to make every person, a worker, an investor, a shareholder, an evangelist, an owner, a creator, a designer. We can fold it all into one. And that\'s really what Web3 is enabling with {coin} at the core. ',
            'You can do anything with {coin} that you can do with a webpage, but on top of it, you can have scarcity and ownership and allocation and rights associated with it. This is really big.',
            'NFTs are artifacts of networks. So you have your own community and the thing, and the NFTs you\'re creating (like {coin}) will be artifacts for that community. And they derive value to the extent that they kind of reinforce that community\'s values and norms and language and memes.',
            'This should be a golden period for creative people. There are eight billion people internet-connected. You only need a thousand to make a living. This should be the greatest time in history for creative people. And I think, thanks to {coin} we might have finally figured it out.',
            'An NFT is not really an object, a digital object. It is a pointer, it is a channel, it is a link, communication between you, the creator, and the community, and any kind of value can be funneled down that.',
            'The problem with most people who "follow their passion" is they never learn the core skills to monetize it (marketing, sales, copywriting, etc.) If you think monetizing your passion will make you not passionate about it…  Just wait until you get paid {coin} for doing something you love - you\'ll simply fall more in love with it.',
            'The market rewards not the best product, but the product who best positions themselves as the obvious solution *cough* {coin} *cough*.',
            '{coin} in theory is the monetization of compute by individual users.',
